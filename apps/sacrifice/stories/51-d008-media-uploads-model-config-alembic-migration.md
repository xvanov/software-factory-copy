# Story

## Title
D008 media_uploads model + config + Alembic migration

## Scope
backend

## Goal
Establish the persistence and configuration foundation for media uploads by adding the `media_uploads` table and configurable storage root required by later upload service and route stories.

# Acceptance Criteria

- A new table `media_uploads` persists per-upload metadata: `id`, `user_id`, `goal_id` (nullable), `sha256`, `size_bytes`, `duration_seconds`, `mime_type`, `storage_path`, `created_at`. Migration generated via Alembic autogenerate.
- Recorded videos are stored under a configurable path keyed by `(user_id, goal_id_or_orphan, upload_id)`. Default: `${SACRIFICE_MEDIA_DIR:-/var/sacrifice/media}/<user_id>/<goal_or_orphan>/<upload_id>.mp4`, where `<goal_or_orphan>` is the goal id when `goal_id` is set, or the literal segment `orphan` when it is not. The setting lives in `backend/app/config.py`. The convention is expressed as a pure path helper `media_storage_path(user_id, goal_id, upload_id)` in `backend/app/models/media.py` (no filesystem access) — NOT in a service module; the upload service is the next story's scope.
- The `SACRIFICE_MEDIA_DIR` override is verified by a test that sets the environment variable (e.g. via monkeypatch) and observes the loaded setting honor it — not by passing a constructor kwarg.
- **Settings-access pattern (operator clarification, 2026-06-11 — both dev and
  reviewer should treat this as the contract):**
  - `media_storage_path(...)` reads the storage root from the app's loaded
    settings (`from app.config import settings`) at call time — neither a fresh
    `Settings()` per call nor a captured copy at import time.
  - The env-override test monkeypatches the environment AND constructs/reloads
    a `Settings` instance to prove env wins, OR monkeypatches
    `settings.sacrifice_media_dir` and asserts the helper output follows it.
    Either is acceptable; demanding more than this is out of scope.
  - Model-persistence tests obtain the EXPECTED path by calling
    `media_storage_path(...)` and compare it to the PERSISTED row's
    `storage_path` — the helper is the single source of the convention; tests
    must not duplicate the format as a hand-built literal.
  - One direct helper test asserting the full default-format output (with the
    literal `orphan` segment for the no-goal case) is sufficient coverage of
    the format itself; additional permutations of the same assertion are not
    required.

# Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add storage-root configuration in `backend/app/config.py` for media persistence.
- [ ] Add `media_uploads` SQLAlchemy model with fields exactly matching the direction.
- [ ] Ensure nullable `goal_id` and ownership linkage via `user_id` are represented in the model.
- [ ] Generate Alembic migration for `media_uploads` via autogenerate.
- [ ] Verify migration creates the required columns and nullability constraints.
- [ ] Express the storage convention as the pure helper `media_storage_path(...)` in `backend/app/models/media.py` using the config setting; tests must call this helper for expected paths instead of precomputing them inline.
- [ ] Do not add upload routes, file-write business logic, or any `backend/app/services/uploads.py` module in this story — that module belongs to the follow-on uploads-service story. If a previous attempt created it, remove it from this branch.

# Dev Notes

## Direction acceptance criteria (verbatim)
- A reusable `<CameraCapture>` component lives at `frontend/components/CameraCapture.tsx`. It:
  - Requests Expo camera and microphone permissions on mount if not already granted.
  - Renders a camera preview with a single "Start recording" button when ready.
  - Toggles to "Stop recording" + elapsed-time indicator while recording.
  - Auto-stops when an optional `maxDurationSeconds` prop is reached.
  - Shows a "Retake" / "Use this video" choice after a recording is captured.
  - Calls an `onCaptured(asset)` prop when the user confirms.
- Denied permissions surface a clear in-screen message ("Camera access is required to submit this proof") with a "Open settings" link and a "Cancel" link that returns the user to the prior screen. The component does not crash on permission denial.
- A new backend route `POST /api/uploads/video` accepts multipart uploads. See `api_spec.md`.
- A new table `media_uploads` persists per-upload metadata: `id`, `user_id`, `goal_id` (nullable), `sha256`, `size_bytes`, `duration_seconds`, `mime_type`, `storage_path`, `created_at`. Migration generated via Alembic autogenerate.
- Recorded videos are stored under a configurable path keyed by `(user_id, goal_id_or_unassigned, upload_id)`. Default: `${SACRIFICE_MEDIA_DIR:-/var/sacrifice/media}/<user_id>/<goal_or_orphan>/<upload_id>.mp4`. The setting lives in `backend/app/config.py`.
- A new endpoint `GET /api/uploads/{upload_id}` returns upload metadata for the owning user only. 403 for non-owners; 404 for unknown ids.
- `backend/app/services/uploads.py` encapsulates path resolution, write, hash computation, and metadata persistence. The route is thin; the service is unit-testable.
- An E2E `@smoke` Playwright test uploads a fixture video via the API and asserts a 201 with the expected response shape. (Pure HTTP test — does not exercise the Expo capture component.)
- A unit test verifies the `<CameraCapture>` component renders the denied-permission state when Expo's permission mock returns denied; does not crash.
- A new context module `context/modules/media.md` documents the capture component, the upload endpoint, and the storage convention.
- `context/architecture-diagrams.md` is rewritten to show the media upload path in the primary system flow.

## flow.md (verbatim)
# User flow

1. From a goal that requires camera capture, the app shows a "Record proof" button on the goal detail screen.
2. User taps "Record proof". App requests camera and microphone permission if not already granted.
   - If the user grants permissions, continue to step 3.
   - If the user denies permissions, app shows "Camera access is required to submit this proof" with an "Open settings" link and a "Cancel" link. Cancel returns to the goal detail screen.
3. App displays the camera preview with a "Start recording" button.
4. User taps "Start recording". App begins recording. The button label becomes "Stop recording" and an elapsed-time indicator counts up.
5. User taps "Stop recording" (or the optional max-duration limit elapses). App stops recording and shows a preview of the captured video with two buttons: "Retake" and "Use this video".
   - "Retake" returns to step 3 (preview ready, no recording yet).
6. User taps "Use this video". App shows an "Uploading…" progress indicator and uploads the video to the backend.
7. On successful upload, app navigates to the goal detail screen showing "Proof uploaded — awaiting verification".
8. Failure modes:
   - Network error during upload — app shows "Upload failed — retry?" with a "Retry" button and a "Save and try later" button. Save-and-try-later persists the file locally for the next app launch.
   - Server returns 413 (file too large) — app shows "Video is too large — try a shorter recording" with a "Retake" button.
   - Server returns 415 (unsupported media type) — app shows "Unsupported video format" with a "Retake" button.

## Story-specific implementation notes
- This story is limited to schema/model/config foundation.
- Later stories own service implementation, POST route behavior, and GET metadata behavior.
- Preserve alignment with existing goal ownership concepts because `goal_id` is optional but ownership-scoped.
