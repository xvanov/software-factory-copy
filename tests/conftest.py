"""Global test isolation.

Several tests call ``factory.runner.text_run`` / ``code_run`` (often with a
fake ``litellm`` module) WITHOUT threading an explicit ``db_path`` or
``software_factory_root``. Left unchecked, those calls fall back to the
production defaults:

  * ``factory.runner._DEFAULT_DB_PATH`` — the real ``state/factory.db`` — and
    write ``Run`` rows there (the ``attempt_n`` counter visibly grew into the
    hundreds across runs).
  * ``signals._events_dir`` — ``$CWD/state/events`` — and append synthetic
    persona-failure records (e.g. SM ``finish_reason=length`` JSON-parse
    failures from the json-retry tests) to the real ``runs.ndjson``.

The live FMS watcher reads those streams and escalates them as genuine
persona failures, so every ``pytest`` run injected phantom SM-truncation
signals that the manager re-escalated to a human every tick.

This autouse fixture redirects BOTH defaults to a per-test tmp directory so no
test can ever touch production state. Tests that already pass explicit tmp
paths are unaffected (they never hit the defaults).
