"""Trace conformance: does the running code emit a trace the model accepts?

Four things are pinned here, in increasing order of load-bearingness:

1. The YAML model agrees with ``_TRANSITIONS``. The checker deliberately does
   NOT import the table (a shared object would hide its own bugs from both
   emitter and checker), so this test is what makes the duplication safe: drift
   becomes a CI failure instead of silent mutual agreement.
2. Each verdict is produced for the right shape of hop.
3. The emitter cannot be bypassed. Every story writer goes through the ORM, and
   the listener is installed by importing ``factory.chain`` — which writing a
   story cannot avoid, because ``StoryRecord`` lives there.
4. **Coverage.** An undeclared writer is a finding, not a pass. Without this a
   conformance check only validates the paths someone remembered to declare and
   blesses everything else — decorative logging (buzz-conformance's own note:
   "coverage breach is load-bearing").
