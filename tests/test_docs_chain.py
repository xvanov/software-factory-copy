"""End-to-end docs-chain integration test (dry-run mode).

Drives a docs-kind story through the orchestrator and verifies the
transitions land in the expected order: STORY_CREATED → DOCS_SM_IN_PROGRESS
→ DOCS_SM_DONE → DOCS_ONBOARDER_IN_PROGRESS → DOCS_ONBOARDER_DONE →
DOCS_ENFORCER_CHECK → PR_OPEN.

The TDD path (test_design / test_impl / dev) MUST NOT appear anywhere on a
docs-kind story's transition history. That's the whole point of the docs
chain — it skips the red→green loop entirely.
