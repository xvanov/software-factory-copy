"""A story row with a state outside the StoryState enum must not abort the tick.

On 2026-07-07 a single row in state ``abandoned`` (not a StoryState value)
made ``_dispatch_for_story``'s ``StoryState(story.state)`` raise ValueError
and halt the entire factory for days. The tick must quarantine the poisoned
row (record it in ``summary.skipped`` — NON-FATAL, not ``summary.errors`` — and
emit an event) and keep driving the healthy stories. Counting the skip as an
error crash-looped the self-tick every cycle (2026-07-21): errors>0 -> exit 1
-> systemd FAILED. Quarantine is data hygiene, not a tick failure.
