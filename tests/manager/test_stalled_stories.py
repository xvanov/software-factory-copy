"""Tests for the ``stalled_stories`` liveness detector.

This detector closes the monitoring blind spot where a silently-stuck factory
emitted no events, the windowed detectors saw an empty window, and the watcher
reported "quiet, healthy." These tests assert it fires on ABSOLUTE state aging
regardless of event activity.
