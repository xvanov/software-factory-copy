"""OpenHands SDK event callback — advances the chain on conversation lifecycle.

Subclasses ``EventCallbackProcessor`` from OpenHands. On each event sent by
the agent-server during a sandbox conversation, inspects the conversation
state and updates the local StoryRecord:

* When the conversation reaches ``RUNNING`` we record start time.
* When it transitions to ``READY`` we record the run succeeded.
* When ``ERROR`` we record the error.

The processor is registered on each conversation in
``factory.runner.sandbox_run`` (Phase 3 wires this; Phase 2 ships the
processor module so callers can ``from factory.webhook.openhands_events
import FactoryEventCallback``).
