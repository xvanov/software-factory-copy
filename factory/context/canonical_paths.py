"""Canonical context paths — single source of truth for what doc files exist.

These constants are referenced VERBATIM from persona prompts. If you rename or
restructure anything in this file, update the persona prompts in
``factory/personas/*.md`` to match exactly.

Rules (enforced by chain handlers in Phase 2+):
  * Every documentation file a persona writes MUST match a pattern in
    ``CANONICAL_CONTEXT_PATHS``.
  * Every documentation file a persona writes MUST NOT match a pattern in
    ``FORBIDDEN_DOC_PATTERNS``.
  * Context is CURRENT-STATE-ONLY: no ADRs, no changelogs, no historical
    archives. The lineage of change lives in directions/, stories/, and git
    history, not in context/.

Paths are evaluated relative to the app repo root (e.g. relative to
``~/sacrifice/`` for the Sacrifice dogfood app).
