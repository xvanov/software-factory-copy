"""Azure provider bootstrap (covers BOTH Foundry and Azure-OpenAI shapes).

Two distinct Azure surfaces are supported. They live in this module together
because they share env-remap mechanics and a single idempotent bootstrap
entry point; the wire shapes diverge entirely.

1. **Azure AI Foundry** (``services.ai.azure.com/models``-style endpoints)
   — addressed in LiteLLM via the ``azure_ai/`` prefix. Foundry exposes an
   OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint at
   ``<base>/chat/completions?api-version=<version>``. LiteLLM auto-downgrades
   to the Azure-OpenAI deployment URL whenever the model name (e.g.
   ``gpt-4.1``) appears in ``litellm.open_ai_chat_completion_models``; we
   monkey-patch that detection off so every ``azure_ai/...`` id uses the
   simpler OpenAI-compatible path.

2. **Azure OpenAI / Cognitive Services** (``cognitiveservices.azure.com``
   endpoints with named deployments) — addressed in LiteLLM via the plain
   ``azure/`` prefix. Each deployment is reached at
   ``<base>/openai/deployments/<deployment>/chat/completions?api-version=X``.
   LiteLLM reads ``AZURE_API_BASE`` / ``AZURE_API_KEY`` / ``AZURE_API_VERSION``
   from the environment automatically — we only need to remap the friendlier
   ``AZURE_ENDPOINT`` name into ``AZURE_API_BASE``.

``ensure_bootstrapped()`` is idempotent and is called at the start of every
Azure-bound runner code path. It:

  1. Remaps ``AZURE_FOUNDRY_*`` env vars → LiteLLM's ``AZURE_AI_API_*`` names
     (Foundry path).
  2. Remaps ``AZURE_ENDPOINT`` → ``AZURE_API_BASE`` (Azure-OpenAI path).
     ``AZURE_API_KEY`` / ``AZURE_API_VERSION`` already match LiteLLM's
     expected names and are left as-is.
  3. Sets ``litellm.drop_params = True`` so newer reasoning-class models
     (``gpt-5.4`` etc.) that reject the legacy ``max_tokens`` get it
     translated to ``max_completion_tokens`` instead of 400-ing.
  4. Monkey-patches LiteLLM's Foundry detection. This is a no-op for the
     plain ``azure/`` path; it only affects ``azure_ai/`` calls.

We never overwrite a value the operator set explicitly.

# input and ~2.5x on output — dev/test_implementer bulk runs on this model,
# so historical ``runs.cost_usd`` for those rows reads low by roughly that
# much. (Cost Management actuals would be the final word but this account
# lacks the RBAC role for the billing API; retail list price is the
# authoritative published rate.)

# cache-hit prompt tokens at whatever that key resolves to — and its

# input rate. Concretely: ``cost_per_token(model="azure/deepseek-v4-pro",
# prompt_tokens=1000, completion_tokens=100, cache_read_input_tokens=900)``
# returned a prompt_cost of $0.000193 (only the 100 uncached tokens billed) —
