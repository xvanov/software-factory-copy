"""Per-unit cost/token/time audit rollups against the ``runs`` table.

D003 — "accurate, complete, auditable per-unit cost/token/time accounting".
This module answers the operator question ``spend.py`` cannot: not just
"how much did we spend today" but "spend broken down by story / by
direction / by app, and how much of it can we NOT attribute to any of
those?"

``CHAIN_PERSONAS`` is the set of personas the D003 direction requires to
stamp ``story_id`` + ``direction_id`` + ``app`` on every run (sm, dev,
reviewer, tech_writer, onboarder, test_implementer). ``docs_enforcer`` is a
deterministic canonical-paths check with no LLM call, so it never produces a
``runs`` row and is intentionally excluded here — including it would make
the unattributed-count denominator wrong. A chain-persona run with a NULL
``story_id`` is "unattributed" — a completeness gap the operator should
drive toward zero for new runs.
