"""Detector: placeholder_prompts — surface persona prompts that shipped with
literal placeholder strings in place of real fetched data.

Background
----------
For months, ``handle_review`` (and ``handle_tech_writer``) assembled their
LLM prompts with three literal placeholder sections — ``(see <path>)`` for
story content, stale ``test_implementer_result_json`` for test output, and
``(fetched from GitHub by the chain — placeholder for real-run)`` for the
PR diff. The reviewer kept asking for clarifications about information that
was already on disk; stories 5, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22 each cycled
dev<->reviewer 5+ times entirely because the LLM never saw the data.

The fix removed the placeholders, added a sanity guard inside the handlers,
and made ``factory.runner.text_run`` log every prompt's metadata (length,
section headers, placeholder markers found, sha256 prefix) to
``state/events/prompts.ndjson``. This detector reads that stream and
returns any record where ``placeholder_markers_found`` is non-empty so the
L1 watcher escalates a regression within one tick instead of letting it
burn another month of cycles.

The detector returns raw rows from the stream. The calling agent decides
severity / urgency based on persona, recency, and how many distinct stories
are affected.

    """Return prompt-log records with non-empty ``placeholder_markers_found``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    root:
        Factory root directory. The stream is read from
        ``<root>/state/events/prompts.ndjson``.
    since:
        Lower bound (inclusive) on the event's ``ts`` field. Records with
        ``ts >= since`` whose ``placeholder_markers_found`` list is
        non-empty are returned, with a ``severity`` field added
        (currently fixed to ``"high"`` — any leaked placeholder is a
        plumbing bug in the dispatch handler, not a transient blip).

    Returns
    -------
    list[dict]
        Each element is the original JSON record from the stream with one
        added key (``severity``). Empty list when the file is missing,
        empty, or no leaked-placeholder rows fall inside the window.
