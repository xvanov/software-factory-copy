"""Detector: stalled_stories — surface ABSOLUTE liveness, not event deltas.

This detector exists to close the monitoring blind spot that let the factory
sit silently stuck for hours: every other detector reads a short rolling
*event window* (``since`` = ~last minute), so when the chain stalls it stops
emitting events, the window goes empty, and the watcher reports "quiet,
healthy." Silence was read as health.

``stalled_stories`` ignores the window entirely. It reads the CURRENT story
state straight from ``state/factory.db`` and the timestamp of the last tick
from ``state/events/ticks.ndjson``, and measures ages relative to ``now``. A
stuck factory produces no events but its DB rows keep aging — so this fires
exactly when the others go blind.

It surfaces three independent liveness signals; the calling L1 agent should
treat a non-empty ``alarms`` list as escalate-worthy:

  * ``stuck_in_progress`` — a story sat in a ``*_in_progress`` state longer
    than ``in_progress_stall_minutes``. A handler was dispatched and never
    returned (process killed mid-run, hang, dirty-tree race, uncaught
    exception). The chain's own stale-recovery may eventually reclaim it, but
    a growing count here means dispatch is wedged.
  * ``stalled`` — a non-terminal, non-deployed story hasn't changed state in
    ``stall_minutes``. Forward progress has stopped for that story.
  * ``no_tick_recently`` — the orchestrator hasn't ticked in
    ``tick_silence_minutes``. The drive loop is likely dead; nothing is being
    dispatched at all.
