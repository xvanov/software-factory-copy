"""factory.manager.staging — canary/shadow deploy for factory self-modification.

Safety foundation (Tier 3 WS3.5): let the factory modify its OWN code
(paths under ``factory/``) without being able to kill itself.

The problem
-----------
When the FMS proposes a change to the factory's own source, applying it
directly to the live repo and auto-merging means a fatal self-edit (an import
error, a broken CLI, a green-but-non-running suite) lands on the running
factory. The circuit-breaker (``factory.manager.circuit_breaker``) can *revert*
a bad self-edit after the fact, but only once a regression is observed on the
live self — the damage window is real.

The mechanism (operator-designed)
---------------------------------
This module is a *shadow deploy* for self-modification. Instead of applying a
self-edit to the live factory, we:

  1. **Sync** a throwaway COPY repo's ``main`` to the real ``origin/main`` so
     the self-edit is validated on top of *current* factory code, not stale
     code (``sync_copy_from_main``).
  2. **Apply** the proposal's diff on a fresh ``staging/<id>`` branch of the
     COPY, commit, and push it to the COPY (never the real factory).
  3. **Validate** by *actually running the cloned factory* in an isolated
     checkout: deps resolve, the full test suite is green, the package imports
     + CLI loads, and a dry-run tick exercises the real orchestration loop
     end-to-end on the changed code (``stage_and_validate_self_edit`` →
     ``StagingResult``).
  4. Only if the clone runs **healthy** does the caller PROMOTE (the existing
     PR-to-real-factory + auto-merge path). A fatal self-edit fails on the
     clone and never touches the live self.

Why no real (non-dry-run) tick
------------------------------
A real tick spends LLM budget and mutates app state. The validation therefore
stops at the held-out behavioral bench — the full suite + import/CLI smoke + a
**dry-run** tick. The dry-run tick still runs the real tick orchestration code
(``factory tick --dry-run`` performs no LLM/GitHub/repo writes), so a self-edit
that breaks the tick loop is caught, without paying for a real run. This is a
deliberate cost/coverage tradeoff: we trade "would a *real* tick succeed" for
"does the changed code import, pass its own suite, and drive a dry tick".

Fail-safe posture
-----------------
Every uncertain outcome resolves to **do not promote**. A subprocess timeout,
a clone/push failure, an unreadable result — all return ``healthy=False`` (or
raise ``StagingInfraError``, which the caller treats as not-promoted + escalate).
A staging infra failure must never crash the L4 manager cycle and must never be
interpreted as "promote anyway".
