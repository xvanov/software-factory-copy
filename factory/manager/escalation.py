"""factory.manager.escalation — make L4 escalations VISIBLE (Tier 3 WS3.1).

The silent-sink problem
-----------------------
Before this module, a manager proposal classified ``escalate_to_human`` or
``forbidden`` died silently in ``state/.manager_apply_history.json``. The FMS
*detected* a real problem, *decided* it needed a human, and then told no human:
no issue, no alert, nothing an operator would ever see. The escalation path was
a ``/dev/null``. Given the FMS escalates ~66% of proposals, that is the single
biggest hole in Ceiling B.

What this closes
----------------
Every escalation now, best-effort:

  1. **Opens a GitHub issue** on the factory repo (``gh issue create`` via the
     injected runner), labelled ``fms-escalation``, whose body carries the
     concern, the proposed action, why it escalated, and the failure evidence.
  2. Is **idempotent** on the proposal's stable ids (``concern_id`` /
     ``proposal_id`` from WS2.2): a re-fired escalation for the same concern
     does NOT open a duplicate issue while one is still OPEN. The dedup
     AUTHORITY is the OPEN-state of the tracking issue on GitHub (a best-effort
     search of open ``fms-escalation`` issues for the id marker); the local
     notification ledger is only a FALLBACK for when gh cannot be consulted.
     This ordering is deliberate: a concern whose issue a human closed/resolved
     and which then recurs MUST be able to re-escalate — so the never-expiring
     local ledger must not permanently suppress it. Anti-spam holds because no
     second issue is opened while one is OPEN for that id.
  3. Emits a loud ``write_alert_event`` so the escalation is visible on the
     alert stream even if ``gh`` is unavailable.

Best-effort contract
--------------------
A ``gh`` failure (missing binary, auth, rate limit, network) MUST NOT crash the
L4 apply cycle — every shell-out is wrapped and swallowed to a logged outcome.
But it must never be *invisible*: the alert event is emitted regardless of
whether the issue could be opened, and a gh failure is itself recorded on the
outcome (and the alert) so an operator/FMS can see the notifier degraded.
