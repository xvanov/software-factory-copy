"""Per-story feature-branch management for the target app repo.

Before any sandbox-touching handler (test_implementer / dev / onboarder)
runs, the chain switches the target app repo to a per-story feature branch
so dev/test commits never land on ``main`` directly. This module owns the
``factory/story-<id>-<slug>`` branch name convention and the idempotent
create-or-checkout logic.

Why this exists at all
----------------------
Phase-8 sandbox runs use ``OpenHands SDK`` to drive the dev/test_implementer
personas inside a real git working tree. The agent's tool calls invoke
``git add``/``git commit`` against whatever branch is currently checked out
— and before this module, that was ``main``. The first bootstrap-context
run produced one local commit on ``~/sacrifice/main`` (kept local only;
never pushed) — visible evidence of the bug.

Idempotency contract
--------------------
``ensure_feature_branch`` may be called multiple times across a story's
lifetime (test_implementer, then dev, then dev-retry, then reviewer). Each
call MUST be a no-op when the right branch is already checked out and at
the right tip; otherwise it switches to it. A non-clean working tree is a
fatal error — we never silently stash or discard the operator's edits.

        must commit / discard their edits first. Silently stashing here would
        eat work; raising is the kinder failure mode.

        stashed under a labeled entry (``factory: leftover for story-<id>-<slug>``)

        tree off between stories — sandbox crashes / dev-exhausted runs can

        the remote ``origin/<base_branch>`` when ``origin`` is configured

        commits into the PR); falls back to local ``base_branch`` otherwise.
