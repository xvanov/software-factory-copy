"""Phase 7 — dual-draft PR flow for ambiguous directions.

When a direction is ambiguous (PM ``confidence < 0.6`` OR ``(explore)``
tag in frontmatter) the factory spawns TWO StoryRecords with materially
different interpretations of the ask. Each story flows through the TDD
chain independently → two ``draft-alternative`` PRs land + a comparison
comment on the Direction Tracker linking both.

This module is intentionally narrow: the *decision* (`should_spawn_dual_draft`),
the *interpretation production* (`produce_interpretations`), and the
*tracker linkage* (`link_alternatives`). Spawning the StoryRecords stays
in ``handle_stories_spawned`` (the dual-draft path is a branch of the
same code path), so the chain's state-machine semantics don't bifurcate.

Dry-run friendly: ``produce_interpretations`` returns a deterministic
two-element list without invoking an LLM, so tests can drive the whole
flow offline.
