"""Auto-merge gate handlers — one module per gate.

A gate is a programmatic check the auto-merge worker runs against a PR
before adding (or removing) the gate's label. Every gate produces a
``GateResult`` record; the worker aggregates them via
``factory.chain.gates.evaluator.evaluate_all_gates``. The canonical label
list lives in ``evaluator.ALL_GATE_LABELS``; the merge-REQUIRED subset for
a given app comes from ``evaluator.required_gate_labels(app_config)``.

Every gate is dry-run aware: when the worker is dry, gates read recorded
StoryRecord state instead of spawning subprocesses. When the worker is real
(a story worktree is checked out), gates re-derive truth by shelling out to
the commands declared in ``apps/<app>/config.yaml.gates`` — trusting recorded
state at merge time is exactly the false-green class this package exists to
prevent.

The gates (one per file in this package):

  * tests_green
  * tests_meaningful
  * docs_current
  * canonical_paths_only
  * smoke_green
