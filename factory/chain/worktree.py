"""Per-story git worktrees — the contention fix for parallel chain runs.

Background
==========

The orchestrator was previously serialised to ``per_repo_concurrent_agents=1``
because every sandbox handler ran against a single shared
``app_repo_path`` working tree. Two stories alive at the same time would
race on ``ensure_feature_branch`` — one's mid-sandbox dirty tree blocking
the other's checkout. We stashed the dirty tree as a stopgap; this module
removes the need to share a tree at all.

Mental model
============

For every in-flight story we keep a private working tree under::

    <software_factory_root>/state/worktrees/<app>-<story_id>-<slug>/

backed by the same ``.git`` directory as the operator's main checkout
(``app_repo_path``). Linked worktrees are a built-in ``git worktree``
feature: they share refs, the index is per-worktree, and the working
tree on disk is isolated. Adding/removing is cheap (no clone) and
``git fetch``/``git push`` work normally because they operate on refs.

Lifecycle
=========

* ``ensure_worktree_for_story`` — idempotent: if the worktree path
  already exists and points at the right branch, returns the path
  unchanged. Otherwise creates it off ``origin/<base_branch>`` (or
  local ``<base_branch>`` if no remote) and checks out the per-story
  feature branch. Stashes any dirty operator state in the source repo
  the same way the stopgap did, because ``git worktree add`` on top of
  an in-use branch needs an unobstructed source.

* ``remove_worktree_for_story`` — called by the orchestrator when a
  story reaches a terminal state (DEPLOYED, BLOCKED_*). Tolerant of a
  missing path; the goal is to leave nothing behind.

* ``prune_stale_worktrees`` — invoked at tick start. Removes worktree
  directories whose ``StoryRecord`` is terminal-and-old OR whose
  branch no longer exists. Keeps disk usage bounded across long runs.

Concurrency
===========

Each worktree has its own HEAD and index, so N stories can each have
their own sandbox running against their own tree without contention.
``git worktree add`` itself takes a brief lock on the source repo's
``.git/index.lock``; that's serialised at the git level. Same for
``remove``. The chain handlers can otherwise operate in parallel.

Safety notes
============

* We never delete the source ``app_repo_path`` — that's the operator's
  workspace.
* ``git worktree remove --force`` discards uncommitted changes inside
  the linked worktree, which is exactly what we want for terminal
  cleanup (the work is either merged via PR or stranded; the chain
  separately commits + pushes terminal stories before cleanup).
* The worktree directory name embeds story id + slug so post-hoc
  inspection (``ls state/worktrees/``) is human-readable.
