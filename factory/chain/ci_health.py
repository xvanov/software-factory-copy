"""Post-merge main-branch CI-health monitor (D004).

The factory already gates PRE-merge required checks (branch protection —
see ``auto_merge._query_ci_state``). This module is the POST-merge safety
net: once a tick, per app, it polls the latest CI state of the app's
``main`` branch and — when a REQUIRED status check is red there — auto-files
a ``ci-health`` direction so the factory fixes it through the normal
dev -> review -> CI -> merge chain.

Design notes:

* The REQUIRED set comes from branch protection
  (``gh api repos/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection`` ->
  ``.required_status_checks.contexts``). A repo with no protection / no
  required contexts has nothing to gate on — the tick does nothing (mirrors
  ``auto_merge._query_ci_state``'s ``None`` convention).
* Advisory (non-required) reds are logged as a warning event only — no
  direction is filed. This keeps this monitor from becoming a second,
  noisier copy of the pre-merge gate.
* Dedup is signature-based: a direction is only filed when no OPEN
  ci-health direction already carries the same (failing-check-names,
  main-head-sha) signature. Deliberately EXCLUDES the ``gh run view
  --log-failed`` digest — that fetch is itself best-effort and can
  flake/timeout independently of the underlying CI failure, which would
  otherwise flip the signature between fetch-success and fetch-fail ticks
  and file a duplicate direction for the exact same red check (caught in
  review). The signature is embedded verbatim in the direction body as an
  HTML-comment marker so a later cycle can find it with a simple substring
  scan — no separate index needed. Because the log digest is no longer
  part of the signature, it is only fetched once we're actually about to
  file (not on every dedup check) — avoiding a repeated ~60s log fetch on
  every tick while a required check sits red.
* Every ``gh`` call is best-effort: subprocess errors/timeouts/unparseable
  output all fall back to "nothing to report" so a flaky ``gh`` never
  crashes a tick or, worse, files a spurious direction.
* KNOWN LIMITATION (documented, not a bug): a required context whose
  workflow triggers only on ``on: pull_request`` never posts a check-run
  against a direct-push-to-main commit (GitHub only attaches PR-triggered
  runs to the PR's merge commit, not to main's tip after a squash-merge in
  some configurations) — this monitor has no coverage for that branch-
  protection shape; it only sees checks that actually run against main.
